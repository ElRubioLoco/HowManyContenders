# HowManyContenders
A Trackmania Next plugin, allowing to see the total number of players who played a map.So you can more precisely see where you are in terms of performance.

## Credits
Many thanks to @Banalian (Lilian Pouvreau) for developping their plugin [ExtraLeaderboardPositions](https://github.com/Banalian/ExtraLeaderboardPositions) and letting people look at the source code. It has been very helpful for me and I would never be able to develop HowManyContenders without it.
